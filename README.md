# soladroid
SolaDroid is an implementation of the Pomodoro technique in an Android application. Pomodroid is already taken so I got all scientific naming on it.

Features:
* The application connects to your Trello account and allows you to setup 3 of your task lists from a board as TODO, DOING and DONE task lists.
*You are able to pick a task from the TODO list and begin working on it using the Pomodoro technique which basically splits your focused work in 25 minute periods, called pomodoros, follwoed by 5 minute breaks.

This is a demo project, it is not available in Google Play and it's sole purpose is to show some coding techniques I use.
Have fun!
